# Rain World Unlimited Passage Mod

By AHDog

For Rain World 1.5

A mod for Rain World that allows the game's fast-travel feature (passage) to be used an unlimited number of times.

NOTE: this mod only works if you've already unlocked the ability to use passages!

## Installation

This mod requires Rain World BepInEx to be installed. 
You can watch the video on how to install it here:

To install this mod, go to the Releases page, and download the file called `RW-unlimited-passage.zip`.
Releases page:

Extract the zip, and move `UnlimitedPassageMod.dll` into your `Rain World/BepInEx/plugins` folder.
If you are using BOI, you can also move it to your `Rain World/Mods` folder.

## Bugs

- Removing the mod also seems to remove the user's passages
