# rw-unlimited-passage-mod
A mod for Rain World that allows the game's fast-travel feature (passage) to be used an unlimited number of times.

## Installation
This mod requires Rain World BepInEx to be installed. You can watch the video on how to install it here:

To install this mod, go to the Releases page:
Extract the zip, and move `UnlimitedPassageMod.dll` into your `Rain World/BepInEx/plugins` folder.
If you are using BOI, you can also move it to your `Rain World/Mods` folder.

## Bugs
- Removing the mod also seems to remove the user's passages
